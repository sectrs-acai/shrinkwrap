# Shrinkwrap

Shrinkwrap is a tool to simplify the process of building and running firmware on
Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVP). Users simply invoke the tool to build the
required config, then pass their own kernel and rootfs to the tool to boot the
full system on FVP.

- Documentation is available at: [ReadTheDocs](https://shrinkwrap.docs.arm.com)
- Source Code is available at: [GitLab](https://gitlab.arm.com/tooling/shrinkwrap)
- Shrinkwrap Container Images are available at: [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/shrinkwraptool)

These Docker images are used by the shrinkwrap tool as a backend runtime.
